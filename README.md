# COMSATS Scripts

This repository contains almost all the scripts I wrote, to help myself with academic stuff while being at COMSATS.
I made them public in a hope that you may also find these scripts useful.

## Contributions

Yes, contributions are welcomed. This codebase has a lot of issues here and there if you find any
of the issues you can fix it or at least open and open an issue describing the bug in full detail.
Also, any effort to make these scripts more accessible for normal users will be appreciated.

## Future Thoughts

I was thinking to make a web app which will make these scripts much accessiable for everyone.
To run python code in browser we can use PyIodide and compile all the required packages to web.

## FAQs

* **Can I ask for the implementation of new subject?** <br> Feel free to ask but there is no guaranty that I will implement that.
